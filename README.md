## 🛠 Prerequisites (Required)

This extension is a frontend for **apcupsd**. It will not work unless `apcupsd` is installed and properly configured on your system.

### 1. Install apcupsd
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apcupsd
```

### 2. Configure apcupsd
Edit the configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf
```
Ensure the following lines are set correctly (especially for USB connected UPS):
- `UPSCABLE usb`
- `UPSTYPE usb`
- `DEVICE` (leave blank for auto-detecting USB UPS)

### 3. Restart the service
```bash
sudo systemctl enable apcupsd
sudo systemctl restart apcupsd
```
Verify it's working by running `apcaccess status` in your terminal.
